# What is this?

Put simply this is my own personal vim set-up and as such it is due to change without notice or warning.

# How do I use it?

First install NeoVim from [here](https://neovim.io/)

Then you can clone this repo like this:

```bash
cd ~/.config
git clone https://bitbucket.org/jhessin/vim.git nvim
cd nvim
```

Then you can run this to get started:

```bash
./setup.sh
```

It may take a while to finish as it downloads all the plugins.
